<chapter title="Introduction" file="Intro">

<cite>FindIBar</cite> is an Icon Bar finder as featured in the new Nested WIMP. If the bar is obscured by windows, move the pointer to the bottom of the screen and the bar will pop up; move the pointer out of the bar and it will fall to the back again.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Installing FindIBar" file="Install">

<cite>FindIBar</cite> requires RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.1 or later. It can be run off a hard disc or floppy disc. Systems with the Nested Wimp (that is: RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;4.02 or better, or where the Nested Wimp is being soft-loaded) should not need it, since they already have the same functionality included as standard.

To install <cite>FindIBar</cite> on a hard disc, copy the <cite>FindIBar</cite> module to a suitable place on your disc. If you want it to run on startup, <cite>FindIBar</cite> should be placed in your boot sequence. On a RiscPC or a machine with the new boot structure installed, this can be done by copying it into the <file>!Boot.Choices.Boot.Tasks</file> directory (<key>shift</key>-double-click on <file>!Boot</file> in the root directory of your hard drive, double-click on the <file>Choices</file> directory that appears, then on the <file>Boot</file> directory, then on the <file>Tasks</file> directory). On older machines you will have to make your own arrangements, although you will probably have built your own boot sequence anyway.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Using FindIBar" file="Use">

Run the <cite>FindIBar</cite> module (double-click it from the desktop, or RMRun it). Better still, for regular use install it somewhere where it will load every time your machine starts (<file>!Boot.Choices.Boot.Tasks</file> on a RiscPC).

</chapter>




<chapter title="*IBarMargin" file="Margin">

One star command is provided, to set the distance from the bottom of the screen that the pointer must be to bring the bar to the front. With no argument, the current setting is printed (2 OS Units, or the bottom row of pixels, by default). Specify a new value to change the distance (eg. <command>*IBarMargin 20</command> would set 20 OS Units).

</chapter>





<chapter title="How It Works" file="How">

<cite>FindIBar</cite> is a bit kludgy &ndash; sorry. This is because the &ldquo;legal&rdquo; way to do what it does &ndash; sending <code>Message_OpenWindow</code> events to the WIMP for the iconbar &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t appear to work. Instead, the program fakes <key>Shift-F12</key> presses and tries to remember where the bar is. Occasionally it can get this wrong; you may need to move to pointer in and out of the bar to fix it.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Source Code" file="Source">

The source for the module is available on my website for those who are interested in seeing how the whole things works. You will need <cite>AsAsm</cite> or <cite>ObjAsm</cite> to get it to assemble.
